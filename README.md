Merkle trees are used in peer-to-peer blockchain networks to validate the transactions in a given block. 
They are typically implemented as binary trees. 
This is an implementation of a ternary Merkle tree, that is, where every non-leaf node has up to three children.

Purpose - 
log3(n) tree traversal vs the usual log2(n)
